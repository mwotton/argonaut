{"tagline":"JSON library","body":"# Argonaut\r\n\r\n### What is Argonaut?\r\n\r\nArgonaut is a JSON library built using Scala. It provides functionality to specify how to convert to and from JSON for an arbitrary Scala object. It relies on the Scala parser libraries (`util.parsing.combinator`) to read an arbitrary string into a JSON data type, which is known to be slow. Argonaut is licenced under BSD3 (see `etc/LICENCE`).\r\n\r\nThe JSON data type also implements a large combinator library in an effort to make it easy to use, however, much of this library would be better implemented by exploiting partial lenses and a zipper.\r\n\r\nArgonaut is intended for simple applications that use specification-compliant JSON. Argonaut is released under a [BSD3 open-source licence](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Lenses and partial lenses for product and sum types, in particular for viewing and updating values of the `Json` sum type.\r\n* A zipper (`com.ephox.argonaut.Cursor`) for traversing and updating a `Json` data structure.\r\n* A traversal data structure (`com.ephox.argonaut.Shift`) that tracks its history of visited positions with an underlying cursor.\r\n* A pretty-printer for outputting JSON values.\r\n* A codec for taking values of arbitrary type to and from JSON values.\r\n\r\n### SBT Settings\r\n\r\nTo use argonaut, add the following repositories to your build:\r\n\r\n    override lazy val settings =\r\n      super.settings ++\r\n        Seq(resolvers := Seq(\r\n          \"mth.io snapshots\"  at \"http://repo.mth.io/snapshots\"\r\n        , \"mth.io releases\"  at \"http://repo.mth.io/releases\"\r\n        , \"snapshots\" at \"http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots\"\r\n        , \"releases\"  at \"http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases\"\r\n        ))\r\n\r\nThen add argonaut as a dependency:\r\n\r\n    \"com.ephox\" %% \"argonaut\" % \"4.0\" withSources\r\n\r\n### Future Improvements\r\n\r\n* Use a more appropriate parser library (not Scala parsers) to improve performance and usability.\r\n\r\n**Copyright 2012 Ephox Pty Ltd**\r\n","name":"Argonaut","note":"Don't delete this file!
